# 🚨 Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning & Spark

This project report outlines the design of a real-time fraud detection system using Machine Learning and Apache Spark, developed under the L&T Edutech Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Foundation program (Semester 6).

## 🧠 Key Components
- **Apache Kafka**: Real-time transaction data ingestion
- **Apache Spark**: Streaming data processing & ML model inference
- **Random Forest Classifier**: 95% accuracy
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Real-time fraud visualization

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- Real-time fraud detection using streaming ML pipeline
- Spark MLlib used for Random Forest model training
- Live dashboard with fraud stats and transaction alerts
- Fraud rate detected: ~2.5% (simulated data)
